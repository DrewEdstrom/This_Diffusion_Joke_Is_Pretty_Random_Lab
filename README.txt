Description:

This program simulates the 1D movement of a particle. The lower the
position is, the further left the particle is. The higher the position is,
the further right the particle is. Includes 5 tests with 10, 100, 1000, 
10000, and 100000 steps taken by the particle for each trial. As
configured, 10 trials are run for each of these step scenarios.
